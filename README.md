# Retro IDE

**Retro IDE** is a sleek, interactive web application designed to provide users with a unique coding experience. The interface is inspired by retro design aesthetics and modern functionality, allowing users to create, compile, and manage their coding projects seamlessly.

This project uses React for frontend development, styled-components for UI styling, and integrates modal functionality for creating new coding environments (playgrounds).

## Features

- **Responsive UI**: The app provides an immersive experience across different devices.
- **Dynamic Background Animation**: Customizable animated background effects for a more engaging user experience.
- **Logo and Branding**: A modern logo with hover effects.
- **Interactive Components**: Buttons with dynamic transitions and hover effects.
- **Modal Integration**: The ability to open modals for creating new projects with various modal types.
- **Great UI Design**: Inspired by retro styles with modern touches.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the frontend components.
- **Styled-components**: For CSS-in-JS styling, offering a smooth integration between JavaScript and CSS.
- **React Context API**: For managing global states (e.g., ModalContext).
- **CSS Animations**: Used for smooth transitions and animations.
